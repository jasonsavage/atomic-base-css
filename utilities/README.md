Atomic design encourages us to first think as vaguely as possible, and then to focus our energy 
on the smallest pieces later. This means that we need a set of system-wide styles to begin; this 
directory of Sass files will need to define the foundation; effectively, what’s required is a set 
of utilities that make up the basic plumbing of the website. This directory of partials is also 
important because we’ll need to define global classes, mixins and styles that can be used anywhere and at any time.
