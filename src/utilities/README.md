Global styles that can be used anywhere and at any time. 
NOTE: Most of these styles are one liners and are allowed to use the !important keyword since they are considered final

Example: 

// These stylesheet definition should be here:
.m-0 { margin: 0px !important; }
.txt-red { }

// This stylesheet definition should be in the components directory:
.form-control.error { }
ul.styled-list { }
